CloudML@ARTIST

What the tool/component is about: 

CloudML@ARTIST has been created as a set of UML profiles able to cover the CLOUD modelling needs.
On the one hand CloudML@ARTIST is focused at creating profiles for each provider under study in order to select the optimal one for migration depending on the characteristics of the legacy application
on the other hand CloudML@ARTIS enrichs the PIM (Platform Independent Model) generated by reverse engineering techniques . As a result, a Platform Specific Model (PSM) is generated in order to allow making semi-automatic deployments of the legacy application to the selected provider by applying M2T transformations.


Current functionality:

CloudML@Artist provides functionality to model different cloud resources , at different levels IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. The main point to be aware is the Multitypes part. This contains attributes that can be included in more than one *aaS levels. In order to reduce schema size and provider descriptions, these characteristics may be divided in two categories:
1.	attributes that are generic with respect to the provider and do not need to be repeated in every offering of the latter (e.g., billing granularity etc.).
2.	attributes that may be different in form or content for each service offering and must be included in each case (e.g., cost of the specific offering).


Known issues: 

Difficulties in visualization due to Papyrus constraints.
